          <strong>Sketcha</strong> is a real-time collaborative whiteboard designed to empower teams,
          educators, designers, and creative thinkers. Whether you're remote or side-by-side, Sketcha

          Inspired by tools like <em>Excalidraw</em>, Sketcha combines the ease of hand-drawn sketches
          with the power of real-time collaboration. Users can join shared rooms and draw together,
          thanks to efficient WebSocket-based architecture.
